"DESCRIPTION":TASK 4:Advanced Encryption Tool

This project is a client-side Advanced Encryption Tool developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in Visual Studio Code. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt files directly in the browser using the AES-256 (CBC mode) encryption standard.

The interface (index.html) lets users upload a file and enter a password. When the user clicks “Encrypt” or “Decrypt,” JavaScript (encryption.js) uses the Web Crypto API to securely process the file. AES keys are derived from the password, and encrypted data is downloaded with a .enc extension. Decrypted files are restored with their original content.

The tool performs all operations on the client side — no backend or internet access is required — making it secure and fully self-contained.

Technologies Used:

Frontend Only: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Web Crypto API)   Editor: Visual Studio Code

Files Used:

index.html – User interface for file upload and password input    style.css – Styling for layout and design    encryption.js – JavaScript logic for AES encryption/decryption
